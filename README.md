# retry-my-fetch

It's a decorator for `Fetch` API ([fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/), [isomorphic-fetch](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch), [cross-fetch](https://github.com/lquixada/cross-fetch), etc.) which allows resending (retrying) your requests in case if that fails.

## npm package

`npm i retry-my-fetch`
